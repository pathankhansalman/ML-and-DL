# plates
This works on classifying a set of pictures of plates to be clean or dirty.

### Credits: This is from the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/platesv2/. For people interested in this, I highly suggest that you check it out.

This takes a training set of 20 pictures of clean and dirty plates (each) and builds a CNN to classify hundreds of pictures from a test set. This is a few shot problem.

### This is a work in progress. Will update the stats once I have the results.
