# movie_recommendations
This works on recommending 20 movies to a given user. This uses movie ratings data, and fits the ALS collaborative filtering model on top of it.

### Credits: This is from the course https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-hands-on-hadoop-tame-your-big-data/. For people interested in this, I highly suggest that you check it out.

This is run using Hadoop FS and Spark. To run as is, you should get the data and store it in a HDFS cluster as described in the course mentioned above. Alternatively, you can make some changes to read the data from a local file and generate recommendations.
