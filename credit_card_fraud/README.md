# credit_card_fraud
This works on classifying a transaction as fraud or not fraud.

### Credits: This is using the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. For people interested in this, I highly suggest that you check it out.

### We implement the following models:

1. XGB benchmark (F1: 0.8129, AUC: 0.8577)
2. XGB CV (F1: 0.7481, AUC: 0.9011)
3. SVM benchmark (F1: 0.8762, AUC: 0.8994)

### TODO:

4. SVM CV
5. Feature selection (PCA/Benchmark important features) + XGB CV
6. Feature selection (PCA/Benchmark important features) + SVM CV
